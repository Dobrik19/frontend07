                    Kingdom of Bhutan  is a landlocked country in the Eastern Himalayas, located in Southern Asia between China and India. It is a mountainous country. Bhutan is known as "Druk Yul," or "Land of the Thunder Dragon". Nepal and Bangladesh are located near Bhutan but do not share a land border. In the Bhutanese Himalayas, there are peaks higher than 7,000 metres (23,000 ft) above sea level. Gangkhar Puensum is Bhutan's highest peak and is the highest unclimbed mountain in the world. The wildlife of Bhutan is notable for its diversity,[16] including the Himalayan takin. The capital and largest city is Thimphu.
